# Workshop Acknowledgements

The tutorial "Using NHGIS Data: A Guide for the Modern Map-Minded Panther" was originally written at the AGSL by [Ben Schroeder](https://benschroeder.com/),
updated for ArcGIS Pro by [Bob Cowling](https://rcowling.github.io/), and edited for this workshop by the presenter.

2021 is my 5th time doing this workshop, thank you to all the previous participants and their generous feedback.

Thank you to everyone involved in GIS Day planning including those who helped me organize the student project competition.

# Acknowledgements for the website template

Thank you to Evan and Phil for their great workshop at WAML 2020 and for sharing [this template](https://github.com/ubc-lib-geo/gis-workshop-waml-template). [Check out this website](https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io/gis-workshop-waml-template/) if you want to make one!

A second shoutout to Evan and Phil for the idea to use [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) for an impactful Land Acknowledgment during virtual workshops.

This template uses [Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll theme.

Heavily influenced and inspired by the [Stanford Geospatial Center](https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter), which is one of the O.G. GitHub contributors for GIS workshops and tutorials.
