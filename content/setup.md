Step 1
{: .label .label-step}
## Basic Setup

The workshop will be held in Zoom.
A camera and microphone are not required, but are encouraged for participation and discussion.
Please prepare to mute your microphone and unmute only when you would like to speak.
{: .step}

This workshop has hands-on components. It's strongly recommended to use two monitors or two devices, one to follow along and one to view the zoom webinar.

## Getting ArcGIS Pro

UWM Students should [follow this link to the Student Software page](https://uwm.edu/software/student-software/)
and find the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro.
{: .step}

UWM Faculty or Staff should [follow this link to the Faculty/Staff Software page](https://uwm.edu/software/faculty-staff-software/)
and find the installation instructions for ArcGIS Pro.
{: .step}

Faculty and Staff can access ArcGIS Desktop only on university-owned workstations under our site license with ESRI. Because of how ArcGIS Pro is licensed, it is available for UWM Faculty, Staff, and Students on personal computers.
{: .warn}

Attendees without UWM credentials should consider a [free trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial)
or using alternative software such as the free and open source [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org).

<summary>Don't want to use ArcGIS Pro?</summary>
<br>
If you would prefer to use QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, or any other GIS for this workshop you are more than welcome to. The tutorial is written for ArcGIS pro, but the tools used are somewhat ubiquitous. If you can perform functions like adding data, joins, and symbology, you should have no problems following along with some adjustment.
